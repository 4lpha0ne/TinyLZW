# TinyLZW
This is a tiny variable LZW implementation in x86 (16 bit) assembly for sizecoding purposes. It is about keeping the code footprint small to use it as a decompressor for tiny executables (mostly COM files).

Right now only a stack based variant is included. An iterative and a recursive variant will follow soon.
